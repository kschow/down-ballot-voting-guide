The legislature needs to increase funding by at least 50%. One representative rightly criticized the state for “neglecting its responsibilities, failing to pick up its fair share of the school finance tab, and pushing the costs down to overburdened local taxpayers.” Abbott’s decision to support quality pre-K education is a wise investment, but the legislature must also allocate adequate funds to educate the other 12 grades and plan for a future that diversifies funding for public education from a mix of resources. We must see education as an investment rather than a cost, since it produces an educated work force, contributes to a stable economy, and improves the health and well-being of all citizens. For those who wish to abandon public education in favor of for-profit systems for education, health, and prisons, this may seem like a just ruling, but those who see an educated citizenry as the bedrock of democracy view it as sidestepping a responsibility that will have unfortunate consequences in the future. Inadequate funding of special needs students may lose Texas up to $223 million in federal funding. SBOE oversees $41.44 billion, but only about $2.5 billion was released in 2019–20. SBOE can tell our leaders to do better."
